# EyeCommander
### An open source computer vision interface that tracks eye movements for individuals with severely-limited mobility. 

#### This is a project started by Lucas Henrique, Daniel Kashkett, and Giovanbattista Amato for AceCentre as part of the 2021 Chronic Coders Coding Academy. The EyeCommander is designed as an open-source solution to eye-gesture detection that will work without the need for a fancy camera or expensive software.

There are two pipelines in this project the first is a OpenCV pipeline. This works  but it can be a bit unreliable with glasses and low light levels. The other is a ML approach. We currently have a Tensorflow ML approach documented here. Initally we are building this up as a docker image and some scripts to validate this more in the field.
