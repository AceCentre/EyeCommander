This is a project started by Lucas Henrique, Daniel Kashkett, and Giovanbattista Amato for AceCentre as part of the 2021 Chronic Coders Coding Academy. The EyeCommander is designed as an open-source solution to eye-gesture detection that will work without the need for a fancy camera or expensive software.
