# EyeCommander
### An open source computer vision interface that tracks eye movements for individuals with severely-limited mobility. 

#### This is a project started by Lucas Henrique, Daniel Kashkett, and Giovanbattista Amato for AceCentre. The Eye-Commander is designed as an open-source solution to eye-tracking that will work without the need for a fancy camera or expensive software.
