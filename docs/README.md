EyeCommander is a desktop application that uses your camera to detect when you blink. Once a blink has been detected you can output that into any desktop application, including communication software like Grid3.

## Why would you use EyeCommander?

To help explain EyeCommander we created two personas that are not based on specific individuals but a collection of people who could benefit from using this technology.

Our first persona is Alexis Anderson who had a brain stem stroke and cannot use body movement to trigger switches. She uses paper based AAC with a limited group of communication partners who understand how she indicates her selections by blinking. Alexis is frustrated that she can only communicate when one of these communication partners are available. Her current solution also means that she cannot access environment control.

Our second persona is Ben Brown who has MND and currently uses eye gaze when he has the energy to do so. Typically, he has to move to a low-tech solution as he becomes tired throughout the day. Ben is very proficient with his high tech device and has learnt where all his vocabulary is stored. It is very problematic that his access depends on having enough energy to use eye gaze and Benâ€™s family is worried that he will be not able to access his eye gaze as time goes on.

Ben and Alexis are both examples of people who would benefit from using EyeCommander. Ben could use it when he is tired and he can continue to use the same vocabulary no matter his energy levels. Alexis can use EyeCommander to communicate independently and not be reliant on the presence of a specific communication partner.
